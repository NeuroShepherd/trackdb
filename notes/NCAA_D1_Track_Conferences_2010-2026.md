## NOTES FOR TRACK AND FIELD DATABASE

1. **IC4A/ECAC**: This is somewhat unique—it's primarily an organization for track-specific championships rather than a full all-sports conference. Schools compete primarily in other conferences but come together for IC4A/ECAC indoor and outdoor track events (particularly in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic).

2. **Cross-Conference Affiliates**: Some schools have different conference affiliations for different sports. For example, UC Davis joins Mountain West for non-football sports but remains in Big Sky for football.

3. **Football vs. Non-Football Splits**: The 2013 Big East split is crucial. Remember that the "American Conference" (born from original Big East football schools) continued and is active today, while a new "Big East Conference" (smaller, non-football) was also created from the non-football schools.

4. **Pac-12 'Death and Rebirth'**: The Pac-12 didn't technically disband, but 10 of 12 members departed (2024). It was rebuilt in 2026 with new members. This is different from a complete disbandment.

5. **Track and Field Specific**: Some conferences like IC4A/ECAC, NEICAAA, and major conference track meets operate somewhat independently of general conference structures for championship purposes.
